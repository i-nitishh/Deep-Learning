Customer Churn Prediction Deep Learning Model
Introduction
Customer churn prediction is a crucial problem for businesses to prevent customer loss and retain their customers. Deep learning models have shown great potential in predicting customer churn, and this repository contains a customer churn prediction model made from deep learning.

Requirements
To use the customer churn prediction model, you will need:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
TensorFlow 2.x
Scikit-learn
You can install the required Python packages using pip. For example:

pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn
You will also need a dataset containing customer information, product usage, and churn records in CSV format. The dataset should be preprocessed to remove missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

Dataset
The dataset used to build the model includes customer information, product usage, and churn records. The data has been preprocessed to remove missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

Model Architecture
The deep learning model has been built with multiple hidden layers and activation functions, designed to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. The model has been trained using an optimizer and a loss function, with early stopping employed to prevent overfitting.

Training and Evaluation
The model has been trained and evaluated on a dataset split into training and validation sets. The model's performance has been evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Usage
To use the model, clone this repository and run the churn_prediction.py script. The script prompts the user for a CSV file containing customer data in the same format as the original dataset. The script preprocesses the data and uses the trained model to predict churn on the validation set. The user can modify the script to load the trained model and make predictions on a new dataset.

Conclusion
This repository contains a deep learning model for customer churn prediction, which can help businesses identify customers who are at risk of churning and take steps to retain them. By reducing customer churn, businesses can improve their revenue and profitability, while also enhancing customer satisfaction.
